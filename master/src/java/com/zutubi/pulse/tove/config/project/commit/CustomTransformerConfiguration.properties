label=custom transformer
introduction=A commit message transformer that has a custom expression and replacement.
verbose=A custom transformer can be used to apply an arbitrary transformation to commit \
  messages. To configure a custom transformer, you specify a regular expression to match the key \
  phrase of interest, and a replacement to substitute for the key phrase. The regular expression \
  is in Java format (similar to Perl format).

expression.label=expression
expression.help=a regular expression that matches the strings to transform
expression.verbose=A regular expression that matches the strings to transform.  The expression \
  should be in Java format.  Groups may be included (using parentheses) for capturing parts of the \
  matched text for inclusion in the replacement.
expression.example.1=^.*?:
expression.example.1.blurb=Match all text up to the first colon
expression.example.2=error
expression.example.2.blurb=Match the literal string "error" (case sensitive)

replacement.label=replacement
replacement.help=the value used to replace matched strings, may include group references from the \
  expression
replacement.verbose=<p>The value used to replace matched strings.  This may make use of group \
  references to include parts or all of the matched key phrase, for example $0 can be used to \
  refer to the entire matched phrase.</p>\
  <p>Note that the replacement will be displayed literally in the pulse web interface. This allows \
  you to use HTML tags in the replacement. It also means that you must take care to escape HTML \
  special characters in the replacement if you want them to appear literally. For example, you \
  should use &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; for &lt; and &gt; respectively.</p>
replacement.example.1=&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f00&quot;&gt;$0&lt;/span&gt;
replacement.example.1.blurb=Turn the matched string red
