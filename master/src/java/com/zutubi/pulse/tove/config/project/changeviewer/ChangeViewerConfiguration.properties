label=change viewer
introduction=The change viewer is an external system that allows you to view changes between revisions. Pulse can integrate \
with change viewers to give you a detailed view of what has changed between builds.
verbose=<p>Change Viewers are used to link from changes displayed in pulse to an external \
  changelist viewer such as ViewVC. This allows integration of pulse with other systems, allowing \
  easy browsing of change information. Viewers can link to some or all of the following:\
  <ul>\
    <li>Changelist views: the changelist number/identifier in pulse is linked to the change view \
        in the external viewer</li>\
    <li>File views: changed files have links to the file view at the corresponding revision</li>\
    <li>File downloads: changed files have links to the download the raw file at the \
        corresponding revision</li>\
    <li>File diffs: changed files have links to the file diff view for the corresponding \
        change</li>\
  </ul>\
  </p>
