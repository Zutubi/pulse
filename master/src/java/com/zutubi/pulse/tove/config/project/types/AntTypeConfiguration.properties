introduction=Ant projects are used to build software with the \
  <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> build tool.
verbose=Ant projects are used to build software with the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> \
  build tool. Ant is commonly used to build Java projects, but can also be used to build software \
  written in other languages.

work.label=working directory
work.help=path, relative to the base directory, in which to execute ant
work.verbose=If you wish to execute ant from a specific directory, provide the path of \
  the directory, relative to the base directory for the recipe. Usually this option is not \
  required, as ant build files can use paths relative to the location of the build file itself.

file.label=build file
file.help=path, relative to the working directory (base directory by default), of the ant build \
  file to use
file.verbose=The location of the ant build file (usually called build.xml), relative to \

  directory for the build unless explicitly specified.

target.label=targets
target.help=space separated list of targets to build (leave blank to build default target)
target.verbose=A space-separated list of ant targets to execute.  This setting is not required; if \
  not specified ant will execute the default target.

args.label=extra arguments
args.help=extra arguments to pass to the ant invocation
