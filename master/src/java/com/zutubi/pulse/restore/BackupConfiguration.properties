label=backup configuration
introduction=These settings configure automatic backups for your Pulse configuration.
verbose=<p>Pulse is able to take automatic backups of your server configuration at regular times. \
  These backups are stored in the archives subdirectory of your data directory.  Only the most \
  recent nine backups are kept (older ones are removed when taking a new backup).</p>\
  <p>Note that the backups do not include server state data, such as build results, which is stored \
  in the database (and should be backed up independently).  Rather, the archives contain all of \
  your server settings.</p>

enabled.label=enable
enabled.verbose=When checked, automatic configuration backups are enabled.
