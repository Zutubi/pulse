data.config.missing=Config file does not exist, and a default one could not be created.  Check that the directory exists and is writable.<br/>\
Until this problem is fixed you will be prompted for the data directory every time you start pulse.

data.directory.what.is.it=<h2>What is the data directory?</h2>\
<p> The data directory is where your pulse server stores all data, including: </p>\
<ul>\
 <li>The pulse database, which contains all configuration information and build metadata.</li>\
 <li>Project build files, such as captured artifacts.</li>\
 <li>Temporary build data, such as the directories in which recipes are executed.</li>\
</ul>
data.directory.where.should.it.go=<h2>Where should it go?</h2>\
<p> This directory may be stored anywhere on the host machine. It is best to keep this directory separate to the pulse installation directory, so that it can be easily backed up and/or upgraded to a new version of pulse. </p>
