The logging subsystem context file contains the logging system configuration.

This context exports:

    logConfigurationManager: During initialisation, this manager setups up the configured logging levels.
                             Prior to the initialisation, the logging level is defined by the systems
                             startup. By default, this is defined within the ConsoleConfig instance.

This context requires:

    configurationManager:

    <!--
    ideally, we want to initialise the log configuration manager as soon as possible. the problem
    is that to locate the correct logging.properties file we need the config manager, which requires
    spring.
    Leave it here for now until a solution presents itself.
