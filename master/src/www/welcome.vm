    <h1> :: what's new :: </h1>
    <p>
        Pulse 2.0 is a major rework, boasting largely new internals that enable important new features.
        Major changes include:
    </p>
    <p>
        <table class="template-actions" cellspacing="5px">
            <tr>
                <th class="category" colspan="2">new in 2.0</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                #actionHeader("configuration.ui" "configuration ui" "accept" false)
                <td>
                    The configuration UI has been completely redone.  All configuration is now in the one place,
                    under 'administration'.  We have used AJAX to create a more consistent interface that is also
                    more responsive.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                #actionHeader("templated.configuration" "templated configuration" "accept" false)
                <td>
                    The new configuration system supports templating: a way to share common configuration between
                    related projects (and agents) by inheritance from ancestor templates.  You will notice that
                    the configuration system allows you to configure a hierarchy of projects/agents, and shows
                    the inheritance relationship of fields.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                #actionHeader("security.system" "new security system" "accept" false)
                <td>
                    User and group management has been updated to allow finer-grained control of security.  It is
                    now possible to assign more specific privileges to groups using ACLs, controlling access to
                    both projects and agents.  It is also possible to configure permissions for all users and
                    anonymous users via two special groups.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                #actionHeader("plugin.system" "plugins" "accept" false)
                <td>
                    Support for various tools is being extracted into plugins.  Further, the new configuration UI
                    is generated: so plugin authors do not need to write any UI code!
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                #actionHeader("predictable.urls" "predictable urls" "accept" false)
                <td>
                    The URL scheme used to access Pulses' resources has been reviewed and updated, allowing improved
                    access to the UI, functionality and resources.
                </td>
            </tr>
