# The context path defined the path below which the pulse web application will be deployed within its
# internal web application server.
#
# That is, pulse web application will be available via http://host:port<contextPath>
#
# For example:
#
#       1) a contextPath of '/' will deploy pulse at http://host:port/
#       2) a context path of '/build' will deploy pulse at http://host:port/build
#
# By default, pulse is deployed in the root context.
#
webapp.contextPath=/

#
# The webapp port defines the port to which the pulse web application will bind to.
#
webapp.port=8080

# The help url points to the location of the documentation that is linked to by the pulse user interface.
