# The data directory is where your pulse server stores all data, including:
#
#    1) The pulse database, which contains all configuration information and build metadata.
#    2) Project build files, such as captured artifacts.
#    3) Temporary build data, such as the directories in which recipes are executed.
#
# Where should it go? This directory may be stored anywhere on the host machine. It is best to keep this directory
# separate to the pulse installation directory, so that it can be easily backed up and/or upgraded to a new version
# of pulse.

#
# The context path defined the path below which the pulse web application will be deployed within its
# internal web application server.
#
# That is, pulse web application will be available via http://host:port<contextPath>
#
# For example:
#
#       1) a contextPath of '/' will deploy pulse at http://host:port/
#       2) a context path of '/build' will deploy pulse at http://host:port/build
#
# By default, pulse is deployed in the root context.

#
# The webapp port defines the port to which the pulse web application will bind to.
