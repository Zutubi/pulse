#
# The version string is the human readable system version string. For example,
# 1.0 or 1.1-alpha. The build number (see below) is the computer readable version
# string.
#
pulse.version=2.6.3-dev

#
# The current system build number. This value is incremented for each software
# release, according to the following format:
#
#   xxyyaaabbb
#
#   where x = major release
#         y = minor release
#         a = build release
#         b - patch release
#
# For example, version 1.0 will be released with build number 0100000000, and version 1.1
# with build number 0101000000.
#
# Maintaining this number:
# ------------------------
# Each time a new upgrade task is written, the current pulse build number should be used as
# the build number for that task, and the pulse build number incremented by 1.
#
# This number should also be updated after each release to reflect the value of the latest release.
# For example: when 1.1.7 was released, the pulse.build property was updated to 0101007000. In the case
# when you are working towards 1.2.0, the build number would be 0101999000, theoretically representing the
# last release prior to 1.2.
#
pulse.build=0206000000

#
# The release date represents the date on which the this versions initial release occurred.
# The is, the date when the major.minor release was made. This date will remain the same for
# all point releases of that version.
#
#       format: d-MM-yyyy
#
# Maintaining this date:
# ----------------------
# Whenever a major.minor release is made, eg: 1.1.0, this date should be updated to reflect the
# release date.  This should always be done for the first released version of a x.x series, even
# if it is only a beta release.
#
pulse.release.date=14-07-2013
