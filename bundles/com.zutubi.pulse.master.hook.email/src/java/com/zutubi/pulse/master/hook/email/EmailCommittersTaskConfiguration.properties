label=email committers task
introduction=An email committers task can be used to send an email to users that committed changes that affected the build.
verbose=<p>An email committers task can be used to send a notification email to users that \
  committed changes that affected the build. This is an alternative to the subscription system \
  that is available to all pulse users to configure their own notifications. The advantage of \
  this task is the ability to notify committers that either do not want to configure their own \
  subscriptions or do not have pulse accounts. It is also a simple way to get started with \
  notifications, allowing users to then customise their preferences as they choose later if \
  desired.</p>\
  <p>To send these emails, pulse needs to map between login names in the project SCM and email \
  addresses. Currently this is done by assuming that the SCM login names and email ids are \
  identical.  This allows you to configure the email addresses by providing just the email \
  domain, which pulse will append to the SCM login (with an "@" in between) to form email \
  addresses.</p>

# Form fields
emailDomain.label=email domain
emailDomain.help=the domain portion to append to scm logins to form email addresses, e.g. example.com
emailDomain.verbose=The domain to send notification emails to. This domain is joined to the \
  committer logins (obtained from the SCM) with an &quot;@&quot; symbol to form email addresses. \
  So, for example, if the SCM reports that users &quot;jsmith&quot; and &quot;pdexter&quot; \
  committed changes, and the domain is set to &quot;example.com&quot;, emails will be sent to \
  &quot;jsmith@example.com&quot; and &quot;pdexter@example.com&quot;.
emailDomain.example.1=example.com

template.label=email template
template.verbose=Defines the template that will be used to render the build result. For example, \
  you can choose HTML or plain text emails.

ignorePulseUsers.label=ignore pulse users
ignorePulseUsers.help=if checked, emails will not be sent to scm logins for which there is a \
  matching pulse user account
ignorePulseUsers.verbose=If checked, users with pulse accounts will not be notified by this \
  mechanism. This allows subscriptions by pulse users to take precedence over this mechanism. \
  Users with pulse accounts are found by matching the SCM logins with pulse logins.
