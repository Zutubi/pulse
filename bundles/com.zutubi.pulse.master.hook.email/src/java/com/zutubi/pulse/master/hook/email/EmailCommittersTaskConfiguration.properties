label=email committers task
introduction=An email committers task can be used to send an email to users that committed changes \
  that affected the build.
verbose=<p>An email committers task can be used to send a notification email to users that \
  committed changes that affected the build. This is an alternative to the subscription system \
  that is available to all pulse users to configure their own notifications. The advantage of \
  this task is the ability to notify committers that either do not want to configure their own \
  subscriptions or do not have pulse accounts. It is also a simple way to get started with \
  notifications, allowing users to then customise their preferences as they choose later if \
  desired.</p>\
  <p>To send these emails, pulse needs to map between login names in the project SCM and email \
  addresses. By default this is done by assuming that the SCM login names and email ids are \
  identical.  This allows you to configure the email addresses by providing just the email \
  domain, which pulse will append to the SCM login (with an "@" in between) to form email \
  addresses.  You can override this default in two ways: by providing explicit mappings from \
  SCM logins to email addresses (via committer mappings in your SCM configation) and/or by turning \
  on the "use scm email addresses" option (if your SCM server knows user emails).</p>

# Form fields
emailDomain.label=email domain
emailDomain.help=the domain portion to append to scm logins to form email addresses, e.g. example.com
emailDomain.verbose=The domain to send notification emails to. This domain is joined to the \
  committer logins (obtained from the SCM) with an ''@'' symbol to form email addresses. \
  So, for example, if the SCM reports that users ''jsmith'' and ''pdexter'' \
  committed changes, and the domain is set to ''example.com'', emails will be sent to \
  ''jsmith@example.com'' and ''pdexter@example.com''.
emailDomain.example.1=example.com

template.label=email template
template.verbose=Defines the template that will be used to render the build result. For example, \
  you can choose HTML or plain text emails.

sinceLastSuccess.label=include commits since last success
sinceLastSuccess.help=if checked, all users that have committed a change since the last successful \
  build will be notified
sinceLastSuccess.verbose=If checked, the committers notified will include not just those that \
  submitted a change new to this build, but all users that have committed a change since the last \
  successful build.

useScmEmails.label=use scm email addresses
useScmEmails.help=if checked, the project''s SCM will be asked to map from SCM logins to email \
  addresses
useScmEmails.verbose=If checked, the project''s SCM will be asked to map from SCM logins to email \
  addresses.  If the SCM is incapable of returning email addresses, or has no email for the given \
  user, the default mapping (user@email.domain) will be used.  Note that this setting does not \
  affect the usage of the committer mappings in your SCM configuration: those mappings are always \
  applied.

ignorePulseUsers.label=ignore pulse users
ignorePulseUsers.help=if checked, emails will not be sent to scm logins for which there is a \
  matching pulse user account
ignorePulseUsers.verbose=If checked, users with pulse accounts will not be notified by this \
  mechanism. This allows subscriptions by pulse users to take precedence over this mechanism. \
  Users with pulse accounts are found by matching the SCM logins with pulse logins.
