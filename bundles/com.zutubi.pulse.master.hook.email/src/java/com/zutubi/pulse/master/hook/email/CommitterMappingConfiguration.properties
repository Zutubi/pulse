label=committer mapping
introduction=Maps from an SCM login to a user email address.
verbose=Committer mappings can be used to map from SCM logins to user email addresses when this \
  mapping is not trivial (i.e. the SCM login does not match the first part of the email address).

scmLogin.label=scm login
scmLogin.verbose=The SCM login to match.  Changes attributed to this login will be mapped to the \
  email address.

email.label=email
email.verbose=The email address to map the login to.  If this address includes an @, it will be \
  taken as the whole address.  Otherwise the email domain from the email committers task will be \
  appended.
