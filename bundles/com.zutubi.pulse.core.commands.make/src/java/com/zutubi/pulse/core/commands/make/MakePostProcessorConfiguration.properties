label=make output processor
introduction=A pre-configured regular expression processor for finding errors in make build output.
verbose=A regular expression processor that is pre-configured with patterns for matching common \
  make error messages.  Note that make commands apply this processing by default, so there is no \
  need to explicitly add this processor in that case.
