introduction=A processor for extracting test results from Boost.Test XML reports.
verbose=The Boost.Test XML report processor can be used to extract test results from Boost.Test \
  XML reports.  These reports can be produced using the flags "--log_format=XML \
  --log_level=test_suite" when running your test binaries.  To capture details for passing checks, \
  use "--log_level=all" and turn on the "process info" option.

processInfo.label=process info
processInfo.verbose=If checked, &lt;Info&gt; elements in the report are processed and added to the \
  test details. This can be used, for example, to show details of all assertions, even for passing \
  tests.

processMessages.label=process messages
processMessages.verbose=If true, &lt;Message&gt; elements in the report are processed and added to \
  the test details.
