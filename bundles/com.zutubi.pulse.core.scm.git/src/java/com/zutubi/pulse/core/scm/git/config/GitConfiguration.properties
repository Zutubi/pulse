introduction=The git configuration defines your SCM integration with a git repository.

repository.label=repository
repository.verbose=URL for the git repository, in the format supported by git clone.

branch.label=branch
branch.verbose=The git branch to check out.

inactivityTimeoutEnabled.label=enable inactivity timeout
inactivityTimeoutEnabled.verbose=If checked, an inactivity timeout is applied to all git commands. \
  See the inactivity timeout field for details.

inactivityTimeoutSeconds.label=inactivity timeout (seconds)
inactivityTimeoutSeconds.verbose=Number of seconds of inactivity after which a git subprocess \
  should be timed out.  Activity is defined as any output from the git command: i.e. if the \
  command does not produce any output for more than this number of seconds, it is timed out.  Note \
  that some versions of git will not produce any status output while cloning, so take care when \
  applying this timeout (especially for larger repositories where operations may take a long time).
