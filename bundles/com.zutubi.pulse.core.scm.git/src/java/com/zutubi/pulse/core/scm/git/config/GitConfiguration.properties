wizard.label=git scm
introduction=The git configuration defines your SCM integration with a git repository.

repository.label=repository
repository.verbose=URL for the git repository, in the format supported by git clone.

branch.label=branch
branch.verbose=The git branch to check out.

inactivityTimeoutEnabled.label=enable inactivity timeout
inactivityTimeoutEnabled.verbose=If checked, an inactivity timeout is applied to all git commands. \
  See the inactivity timeout field for details.

inactivityTimeoutSeconds.label=inactivity timeout (seconds)
inactivityTimeoutSeconds.verbose=Number of seconds of inactivity after which a git subprocess \
  should be timed out.  Activity is defined as any output from the git command: i.e. if the \
  command does not produce any output for more than this number of seconds, it is timed out.  Note \
  that some versions of git will not produce any status output while cloning, so take care when \
  applying this timeout (especially for larger repositories where operations may take a long time).

trackSelectedBranch.label=only track selected branch
trackSelectedBranch.help=optimise checkout by only tracking the selected branch (instead of a full \
  clone)
trackSelectedBranch.verbose=Optimises checking out from the remote repository by only tracking the \
  selected branch rather than performing a full clone.  This can be useful if the repository is \
  large and contains many branches that are not required for your build.  Only enable this option \
  if you are sure your build does not need a full clone to work with.
