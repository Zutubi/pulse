label=tag task
introduction=A tag task can be used to tag the built revision in the SCM.
verbose=<p>The apply tag task can be used to tag (or label) the built revision when a hook is \
  triggered. When the task is executed, it will apply a tag to all source files used in the build \
  at the revisions that were built. Typical use cases include:\
  <ul>\
    <li>tagging all builds with the project name and build number: so that your SCM has a record \
    of all built revisions</li>\
    <li>maintaining a &quot;last known good&quot; tag: by tagging only after successful builds \
    with a moving tag (see the &quot;move existing tag&quot; option)</li>\
  </ul></p>\
  <p>Tags are usually applied in post build hooks.</p>
