buildFile.help=path, relative to the working directory (base directory by default), of the nant \
  build file to use
buildFile.verbose=The location of the NAnt build file (usually ending in .build), relative to \
  the working directory in which NAnt is executed.  The working directory will be the base \
  directory for the build unless explicitly specified.

targets.example.1.blurb=To run the clean and then the test target

exe.label=custom nant executable
