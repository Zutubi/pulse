introduction=A pre-configured regular expression processor for finding errors and warnings in NAnt \
  build output.
verbose=A regular expression processor that is pre-configured with patterns for matching common \
  NAnt error and warning messages (including those from csc).  Note that NAnt commands apply this \
  processing by default, so there is no need to explicitly add this processor in that case.

example.trivial.blurb=A trivial nant post-processor
example.contextNoFailOnError.blurb=Increase the amount of leading context captured to ten lines, \
  and disable fail-on-error
