label=msbuild output processor
introduction=A pre-configured regular expression processor for finding errors in MsBuild output.
verbose=A regular expression processor that is pre-configured with patterns for matching common \
  MsBuild error messages.  Note that msbuild commands apply this processing by default, so there \
  is no  need to explicitly add this processor in that case.
