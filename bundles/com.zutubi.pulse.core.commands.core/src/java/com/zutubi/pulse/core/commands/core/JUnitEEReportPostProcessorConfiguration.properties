label=junitee xml report processor
introduction=JUnitEE processors can extract test results from XML reports produced from JUnitEE \
  tests.
verbose=The JUnitEE post-processor can be used to process XML reports in the format produced by \
  the junitreport task of the Apache Ant build tool. It is a simple customisation of the JUnit \
  post-processor to work out-of-the-box with tests written using JUnitEE.
