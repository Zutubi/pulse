introduction=The perforce configuration defines your scm integration with a perforce server.
verbose=<p><a href="http://www.perforce.com/">Perforce</a> is a commercial, multi-platform SCM made by \
  Perforce Software. Support for Perforce in pulse is built on top of the command line client p4. \
  This client is available from Perforce for a wide range of platforms, and is distributed as a single \
  binary file which can be easily installed on any machine. To use Perforce from your pulse server, \
  ensure that the p4 binary is installed on the host machine and is in the PATH for the pulse process.</p>\
  <p>Perforce configuration in pulse uses the same terminology as the Perforce tools themselves. For \
  further details about the configuration options, consult the \
  <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.091/manuals/p4guide/index.html">documentation</a> for p4.</p>

port.label=port
port.help=analogous to the P4PORT environment variable.
port.verbose=This value is analogous to the P4PORT environment variable. It should contain the server \
  name and port for the Perforce server, separated by a colon. Either field may be blank, in which case \
  the default is used ("perforce" and "1666" respectively), but the colon should always be given.
port.example.1=perforce:1666
port.example.1.blurb=To specify the default explicitly
port.example.2=:1234
port.example.2.blurb=Port &quot;1234&quot; on the local machine

user.label=user
user.verbose=Analogous to the P4USER environment variable. The login name to use for connecting to the \
  Perforce server.

useTicketAuth.label=use ticket authentication
useTicketAuth.help=if checked, login using p4 login to obtain a ticket before running commands
useTicketAuth.verbose=Check this option to use ticket authentication rather than just setting \
  P4PASSWD.  In this case, Pulse will log in using p4 login to obtain a ticket before running any \
  other p4 command.  The ticket will then be used to set P4PASSWD.  This is only required if your \
  Perforce server is set to use security level 3, where only tickets are accepted.

password.label=password
password.verbose=Analogous to the P4PASSWD environment variable. The password for the user \
  specified above.  Note that when using ticket authentication, this value is passed to p4 login \
  rather than being set in P4PASSWD directly.

spec.label=template client
spec.help=client specification, used as a template when creating clients for this project
spec.verbose=\
  <p>Similar to the P4CLIENT variable, although the client specified will not be used directly. This \
  field specifies the name of a client specification to use as a <strong>template</strong> for pulse \
  to create temporary clients when connecting to Perforce. Whenever pulse communicates with the Perforce \
  server, it will create a temporary client for that purpose. The created client will have the same view \
  of the depot (to use Perforce terminology) as the specified template client. However, the temporary \
  client''s root will be changed appropriately, and the client will be deleted when the interaction \
  is complete. Using temporary clients in this way prevents problems arising from Perforce maintaining \
  client state on the Perforce server.</p>\
  <p>If you do not have a suitable template client in Perforce, you can create one using your Perforce \
  tools. Any developer working on the code line should have a client suitable to use as a template. By \
  keeping the template client in Perforce up to date with any changes to your source code layout, there \
  is no need to modify your settings in pulse.</p>
spec.example.1=example-trunk

syncWorkspacePattern.label=sync workspace pattern
syncWorkspacePattern.verbose=<p>Pattern used to derive the name for the workspace used to bootstrap \
  the project on each agent.  In most circumstances this pattern should be left unchanged, as an \
  incorrect setting may lead to confusing behaviour.</p>\
  <p>The pattern may reference variables in the context of the build.  Note that the pattern should \
  include the properties $(agent.handle) and $(project.handle) to ensure it is unique for each \
  agent/project combination.  If you have multiple agents at a single location, you can replace \
  $(agent.handle) with $(host.id) to share a single workspace for a project on a host.  In this case \
  you must also update the persistent work directory pattern for the project so that it does not \
  include the agent name or handle.</p>\
