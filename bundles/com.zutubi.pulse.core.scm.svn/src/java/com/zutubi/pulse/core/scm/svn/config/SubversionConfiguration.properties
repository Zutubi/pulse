wizard.label=subversion scm
introduction=The Subversion configuration defines your scm integration with a Subversion server.

username.label=username
username.verbose=Specifies the username to use to connect to the subversion server. The user must have access to the \
  URL specified.

url.label=url
url.verbose=Specifies the URL of the subversion repository you would like to check out from, including the protocol to \
  use, the location of the server and path of the code line within the server. The URL given should be in the exact \
  form used for the checkout command of the command line client svn.
url.example.1=http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/oro/trunk/
url.example.1.blurb=To checkout the Jakarta ORO source over HTTP
url.example.2=svn+ssh://svn.example.com/svn-repo/my-project/trunk/
url.example.2.blurb=To checkout the trunk of "my-project" from server "svn.example.com" using svn over ssh

password.label=password
password.verbose=<p>If the user configured above requires a password for authentication, it should be supplied in this \
  field.</p><p>This field is not required, and need not be specified when using anonymous access or other \
  authentication methods.</p>

keyfile.label=private key file
keyfile.help=if using ssh key authentication, full path to the private key file to use
keyfile.verbose=If using ssh private key authentication, the absolute path to the private key file on the pulse host \
  machine.

keyfilePassphrase.label=key file pass phrase
keyfilePassphrase.help=if using an encrypted private key file, the key file passphrase
keyfilePassphrase.verbose=<p>If using an ssh key file that has been encrypted with a passphrase, specify that \
  passphrase using this field.</p><p>This field is not used unless key file is set.</p>

externalMonitorPaths.label=external monitor paths
externalMonitorPaths.help=list of paths (relative to the url) to read the svn:externals property from to monitor externals
externalMonitorPaths.verbose=<p>Pulse includes some support for monitoring svn:externals references, as long as those \
  references point into the same Subversion repository. To enable this support, you should set this field to a list of \
  paths to check the svn:externals property for. These paths are relative to the Subversion URL specified above (to \
  refer to the base of the checkout, use "."). When this field is set, pulse will monitor not only the URL specified \
  above, but also any URLs referenced in the svn:externals properties of the paths listed in this field.</p><p>Note \
  that only URLs referring to the same Subversion repository are supported. Additionally, when checking out or updating \
  source to a fixed revision (the normal case for a build), pulse will force code from the externals to the revision \
  by a subsequent update in each external working copy.</p>

verifyExternals.label=verify externals
verifyExternals.help=if checked, externals urls will be checked to ensure they refer to the same repository
verifyExternals.verbose=If using svn:externals support (see above), only externals from the same Subversion repository \
  are supported. By default this is verified by pulse. However, as this may take significant time, you may wish to \
  disable verification by unchecking this option.
