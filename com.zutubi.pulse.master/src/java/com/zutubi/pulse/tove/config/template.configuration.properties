# Overview Documentation.
#
#    label       : The label presented at the top of the page when presenting the configuration object,
#                  or used to identify the configuration object when it is nested in another page.
#    label.plural: The plural form of the label, only necessary if the type is used in a collection and
#                  automatic pluralisation fails
#    form.heading: Used to override the label when displaying a form and in documentation when desired.
#                  Typically this happens when the label describes more than just a single object, i.e.
#                  it includes nested objects (e.g. "ant command and artifacts").
#    introduction: An introduction into the purpose of this configuration object, how it is used,
#                  when it is used and any special details.  Should be full sentences with captilisation
#                  etc.
#    verbose     : Full description of the configuration object used in documentation.
