label=agent ping configuration
introduction=Settings used to control how and when the master pings agent hosts.
verbose=These settings can be used to control how and when the master pings agents.  Regular pings are used by the \
  master to check the status of agent hosts.

pingInterval.label=ping interval (secs)
pingInterval.verbose=The minimum time, in seconds, between rounds of agent pings. The actual time between the start of \
  two rounds may be longer.
pingInterval.example.1=60

pingTimeout.label=ping timeout (secs)
pingTimeout.verbose=The maximum time, in seconds, that the master will wait for a reply to a ping of an agent. If the \
  agent does not reply in this time period, then it is deemed to be offline.  This value should be less than the ping \
  interval.
pingTimeout.example.1=45

offlineTimeout.label=offline timeout (secs)
offlineTimeout.verbose=Minimum amount of time, in seconds, that must pass without a successful ping before pulse will \
  fail a stage because the connection to the agent appears to have been lost.  This value should typically be as long \
  as multiple ping intervals to allow a few failed pings before determining that the build must be aborted.
offlineTimeout.example.1=240

timeoutLoggingEnabled.label=enable timeout logging
timeoutLoggingEnabled.verbose=If checked, timeouts when pinging agents will be recorded in the system logs.  You may \
  choose to disable this logging if some of your agents are expected to be offline a significant amount of the time.

maxConcurrent.label=max concurrent pings
maxConcurrent.verbose=The maximum number of pings to allow to run concurrently.  Note that each ping will consume two \
  threads.
