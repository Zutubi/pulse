# Overview Documentation.
#
#    label       : The label presented at the top of the page when presenting the configuration object,
#                  or used to identify the configuration object when it is nested in another page.
#    label.plural: The plural form of the label, only necessary if the type is used in a collection and
#                  automatic pluralisation fails
#    form.heading: Used to override the label when displaying a form and in documentation when desired.
#                  Typically this happens when the label describes more than just a single object, i.e.
#                  it includes nested objects (e.g. "ant command and artifacts").
#    introduction: An introduction into the purpose of this configuration object, how it is used,
#                  when it is used and any special details.  Should be full sentences with captilisation
#                  etc.
#    verbose     : Full description of the configuration object used in documentation.

# Simple field documentation (i.e. form fields):
#
#    <fieldName>.label            : A couple of words used to identify the field.
#    <fieldName>.help             : Basic help, displayed in the ui, to assist a user filling in this field.
#                                   Should be a brief phrase with no capitalisation or period.
#    <fieldName>.verbose          : A verbose description of the field used in documentation.
#    <fieldName>.example.<n>      : An example value for the field (number each example starting at 1).
#    <fieldName>.example.<n>.blurb: A short description of the numbered example.
#
# (proposed)
#    <fieldName>.hint       : an initial value to be displayed in the field if no value exists, to provide
#                             guide to what is expected.
#    <fieldName>.doc        : concise developer friendly documentation for this field
#

#
# Form error messages.  The field messages will vary based on the actual configured validators and the keys they
# generate.  Error keys will be of the form "<fieldName>.<errorKey>", e.g. myField.min
#

#
# Nested field documentation:
#
#     <fieldName>.label: Overrides the defaul label for the field in the config tree (the default is
#                        the label of the field type, pluralised if necessary)
#

#
# State:
#
#     state.heading    : heading for the state display table
#     <fieldName>.label: label for a state display filed
#

# Actions:
#
#     <actionName>.label: Text for an action link.
#

#
# Wizard:
# When this type is an extension that may be chosen in a wizard:
#
#     wizard.label: label for this type when presented in the type selection dropdown (defaults to label)
#
