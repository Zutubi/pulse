label=browse view settings
introduction=These settings control the display of the browse view which lists all projects.
verbose=The browse view settings are used to customise your view of the browse page.  This \
  helps you see the information most important to you.  The browse view is still a central \
  place to view all projects - for an even more targeted view use the dashboard.

groupsShown.label=group by label
groupsShown.verbose=If checked, projects will be grouped by labels assigned to them (in the project \
  configuration).  Projects may appear in multiple groups, and all ungrouped projects will be \
  displayed in a special group at the end of the page.
