baseUrl.verbose=<p>The base url used to access pulse. This value is used to form links to the host \
  in notifications (for example, the link to the build result in a build notification email). Your \
  pulse server will try to guess an appropriate value when it is set up, however it may be \
  necessary to configure this setting manually so that the generated links work from all computers \
  in your network.</p>\
  <p>Note that you should specify a valid url, including the protocol (eg: http://)</p>
baseUrl.example.1=http://ronnie:8080
baseUrl.example.1.blurb=For a server running on a host named &quot;ronnie&quot; in your internal \
  network
baseUrl.example.2=http://build.example.com:1234
baseUrl.example.2.blurb=A public host running on custom port &quot;1234&quot; at\

  pulse from http: //www.company.com/build
