primaryType.verbose=The primary project type controls how you configure recipes for the project.  \
  Recipes in turn control what commands are run to build the project.  The following options are \
  available:\
  <ul>\
    <li>custom project: a project that has recipes configured using a hand-written Pulse XML file. \
        The XML file is stored with your other project configuration on the Pulse master.</li>\
    <li>multi-step project: a project that has recipes configured via the Pulse web UI.  This type \
        is expected to contain multiple recipes and/or multiple commands in a recipe.</li>\
    <li>single-step project: a special-case of the multi-step project where a simple, single \
        command recipe is created during this wizard.  You can choose to add more commands and/or \
        recipes later using the Pulse web UI.</li>\
    <li>versioned project: a project that has recipes configured using a hand-written Pulse XML \
        file.  The XML file is stored in your SCM server alongside the project source code.</li>\
  </ul>
