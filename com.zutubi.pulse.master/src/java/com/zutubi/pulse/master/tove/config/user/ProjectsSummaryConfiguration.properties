hierarchyShown.label=show project hierarchy
hierarchyShown.verbose=If checked, both template and concrete projects will be displayed in their \
  hierarchy.  When projects are also grouped by label the hierarchy shown will be based only on the \
  concrete projects that fall in each group.
hiddenHierarchyLevels.label=hierarchy levels to hide
hiddenHierarchyLevels.verbose=The number of template hierarchy levels to hide when showing the project \
  hierarchy.  The levels are hidden from the root downwards (i.e. when set to one the global project \
  template will be hidden).  This is useful when you don't want to see hierarchy levels which are purely \
  abstract and only meaningful for configuration.
buildsPerProject.label=builds per project
buildsPerProject.verbose=The number of recent builds to display per project.  By default only the latest \
  build is shown, you can increase this value if you would like to see more recent history.
columns.label=build details to show
columns.verbose=Determines both which build details are shown to the right of the page and the order \
  in which they are displayed.  Use this setting to show only the details that are important to you.
