introduction=Groups are used to assign permissions to users.
verbose=<p>Groups in pulse are used to grant additional privileges to users.  By default, all users can view build \
  results, the configuration of projects and agents and have their own preferences.  Using groups you can grant \
  additional privileges such as the ability to configure projects, run personal builds, trigger builds, disable agents \
  and more.</p>\
  <p>Note that only server permissions are assigned directly in the group interface.  Project- and agent-specific \
  privileges are granted using ACLs, which are configured on the projects and agents themselves.</p>
