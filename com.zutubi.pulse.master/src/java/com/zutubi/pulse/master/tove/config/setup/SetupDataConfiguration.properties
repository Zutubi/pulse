verbose=<h3>What is the data directory?</h3>\
        <p> The data directory is where your pulse server stores all data, including:</p>\
        <ul>\
            <li>The pulse database, which contains all configuration information and build metadata.</li>\
            <li>Project build files, such as captured artifacts.</li>\
            <li>Temporary build data, such as the directories in which recipes are executed.</li>\
        </ul>\
        <h3>Where should it go?</h3>\
        <p> This directory may be stored anywhere on the host machine. It is best to keep this directory \
            separate to the pulse installation directory, so that it can be easily backed up and/or \
            upgraded to a new version of pulse.</p>
