label=artifact repository
introduction=The artifact repository configuration controls who has default access to the embedded Pulse artifact \
  repository.
verbose=Pulse contains an embedded artifact repository that is accessible via ''http://.../repository''.  \
  <p>By default, the access to this repository is controlled by the project permissions.  If a user can view \
  a project, then they can view that project''s artifacts within the repository.\
  <p>The artifact repository can be used to store your own artifacts, independent of Pulse.  To control access \
  to these artifacts, use the read access and write access lists below to define which groups have what access \
  to the repository.

readAccess.label=read access
readAccess.verbose=This list defines the groups that are allowed to read the contents of the artifact repository. Be \
  aware that specific project permissions will override this list.

writeAccess.label=write access
writeAccess.verbose=This list defines the groups that are allowed to write to the artifact repository. Be \
  aware that specific project permissions will override this list.
