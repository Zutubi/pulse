label=custom condition
introduction=A custom boolean condition to use for matching builds.
verbose=This condition allows you to specify your own boolean expression that determines which builds you will be \
  notified of.

customCondition.label=expression
customCondition.verbose=A condition is a boolean expression made up of boolean values (e.g. changed, failure), boolean \
  operators (e.g. and, or) and comparison expressions. A comparison expression is in turn made up of integer values \
  (e.g. unsuccssful.count.days, 5) and integer operators (e.g. <, ==). A condition must evaluate to true for a \
  notification to be sent.  Refer to the Pulse manual for full details.
customCondition.example.1=true
customCondition.example.1.blurb=To match all builds
customCondition.example.2=not success and changed(by.me)
customCondition.example.2.blurb=Builds that you may have broken will be unsuccessful and will have changes by you
customCondition.example.3=not success or state.change
customCondition.example.3.blurb=Detect unsuccessful builds with &quot;not success&quot;. The first success can be \
  captured by &quot;state.change&quot;, as the build must have changed from unsuccessful to successful
customCondition.example.4=unsuccessful.count.days &gt;= 3
customCondition.example.4.blurb=Builds broken for three or more days
customCondition.example.5=unsuccessful.count.days(previous) &lt; 3 and unsuccessful.count.days &gt;= 3
customCondition.example.5.blurb=Builds broken for three days, notify only once
