label=project dependencies

introduction=The project dependencies defines the set of projects that this project \
  depends upon.  The dependent project'''s publications are retrieved at build time and are made \
  available to this project'''s build.

dependencies.label=dependencies
dependencies.verbose=The list of dependent projects whose publications are delivered to the \
  working directory of this project during the build'''s bootstrap phase.  The exact delivery location \
  is defined by the retrieval pattern.

publicationPattern.label=publication pattern
publicationPattern.verbose=defines a pattern that describes where the \
  publications can be found.  This pattern can include the following tokens\
  <ul>\
  <li>[artifact]: the name of the artifact</li>\
  <li>[ext]: the artifact file'''s extension </li>\
  <li>[type]: the type of the artifact.</li>\
  </ul>
publicationPattern.example.1=build/[artifact].[ext]
publicationPattern.example.1.blurb=The publications are located in the base.dir/build directory \
  and are defined by the publication'''s name and extension
publicationPattern.example.2=build/sample-[artifact].[ext]
publicationPattern.example.2.blurb=The publications are located in the base.dir/build directory \
  and all publication file names have the prefix '''sample-'''
publicationPattern.example.3=build/[type]/[artifact].[ext]
publicationPattern.example.3.blurb=The publications are located in the base.dir/build directory \
  and further subdivided based on a type classification.  For example, build/txt/artifact.txt

retrievalPattern.label=retrieval pattern
retrievalPattern.verbose=defines a pattern that describes where a project'''s\
  dependencies will be delivered.  The pattern can include the following tokens \
  <ul>\
  <li>[artifact]: the name of the artifact</li>\
  <li>[ext]: the artifact file extension, and </li>\
  <li>[revision]: the revision of the artifact.</li>\
  <li>[type]: the type of the artifact.  If not specified during publication, the type field defaults \
  to the file extension.  That is, the type of artifact.jar is by default '''jar'''.</li>\
  </ul>
retrievalPattern.example.1=lib/[artifact].[ext]
retrievalPattern.example.1.blurb=The dependencies are delivered into the base.dir/lib directory
