verbose=<p>Labels are used for flexible categorisation of projects.  Projects that share a label \
  form a project group, and these groups can be used to organise the browse and dashboard views in \
  the pulse UI.</p>\
  <p>Labels are preferred to explicit creation of groups as they interact well with templates and \
  inheritance.  For example, you can add a project template and all of its descendants to a group \
  simply by adding a label to the template itself.</p>
