introduction=An agent is a server that can be used to execute builds.
verbose=<p>Builds performed by your pulse server are executed by dispatching recipes to agents.\
  Your pulse server has its own built-in agent by default, known as the master agent. You can also \
  run agents on other hosts, known as remote agents.</p>\
  <p>Note that it is possible to run multiple agents on the same host, including multiple master \
  agents.  To do so, use the same host and port settings for multiple agents (preferrably in a \
  common template, which you can also use to manage other common settings).  Pulse will \
  automatically recognise that the agents share a host and will manage the host appropriately.</p>

name.label=name
name.verbose=A descriptive name for the agent.
name.required=name is required

remote.label=remote
remote.help=if checked, the agent is a remote process on another server, otherwise the agent is \
  local to the master
remote.verbose=If checked, the agent is a remote process on another server, otherwise the agent is \
  local to the master.  It is recommended that you only use a single local agent.

host.label=host
host.help=address of the server on which the agent is installed
host.verbose=For remote agents, the address of the machine the agent is running on.  This may \
  either be a hostname or IP address.  To run multiple agents on the same host, give them the same \
  host and port settings (preferrably via a common template).

port.label=port
port.invalid=port must be a positive integer
port.min=port must be a positive integer
port.help=port the agent is listening on
port.verbose=The port the agent is listening on, which is 8090 by default.  Take care to ensure \
  that this port is not blocked by a firewall or similar.  To run multiple agents on the same \
  host, give them the same port and host settings (preferrably via a common template).

ssl.label=use ssl
ssl.verbose=<p>If checked, connections established from the master to this agent will use SSL. \
  This option must be used in conjunction with SSL configuration on the agent side (i.e. \
  configuring the agent to listen for secure connections via its config.properties file).</p>\
  <p>For a secure connection to be established the agent''s certificate must be trusted by the \
  master''s JVM.  If you are using self-signed certificates you will generally need to import the \
  agent''s certificate into the master''s keystore manually.</p>\
  <p>Note that this option does not effect connections established from the agent to the master. \
  Those connections will use SSL only if the master itself is configured to listen for secure \
  connections.</p>

allowPersonalBuilds.label=allow personal builds
allowPersonalBuilds.verbose=If checked, personal builds may be assigned to this agent.  It may \
  be desirable from a resource sharing or security perspective to disallow personal builds on \
  certain agents.

priority.label=priority
priority.help=higher priority agents are preferred when assigning builds
priority.verbose=An arbitrary number designating a priority for this agent.  Agents with higher \
  priorities are preferred when assigning recipes to build.  When agents have the same priority, \
  the tie is broken by an arbitrary combination of agent and project name, which helps to bias \
  builds to run on the same agent (for better performance for incremental builds).
