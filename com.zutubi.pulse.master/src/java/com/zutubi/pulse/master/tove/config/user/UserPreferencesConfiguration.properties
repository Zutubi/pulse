label=preferences
introduction=Your personal preferences allow you to configure your interface to pulse.
verbose=Users of pulse are each given their own, customisable view of the pulse server. In addition to having a \
  personal home page, you can also control your own settings, including user interface preferences and how and when \
  you should be notified of build information by the pulse server.

aliases.label=aliases
aliases.verbose=<p>Aliases are used to match up your identity in pulse with your identity in your SCM server(s). \
  Usually, you would ensure that your login name in pulse matches your login in your SCM server. However, if this is \
  not possible for some reason, you can instead add an alias to your profile that matches your login in the \
  appropriate SCM.</p>\
  <p>If neither your login nor any of your aliases match your login name in your SCM server you can still use pulse, \
  however pulse will be unable to detect which source code changes are made by you. This will mean certain features \
  (such as the &quot;recent changes by me&quot; table) will not operated as expected.</p>

defaultAction.label=default page
defaultAction.verbose=This setting controls the page you are taken to when you log in. You can choose one of the \
  welcome page with which you are greeted when first logging in, your personal home page or the browse page.

myBuildsCount.label=number of personal builds
myBuildsCount.verbose=The number of personal builds to retain for viewing on your &quot;my builds&quot; tab.  Older \
  personal builds are automatically deleted.

refreshingEnabled.label=enable content refreshing
refreshingEnabled.verbose=<p>Much of the information displayed in the pulse web interface is constantly updating as \
  project builds are being executed. To ensure that you see up-to-date content when you keep a browser open viewing a \
  pulse page, all live content in pulse may be automatically refreshed. Examples of live content includes build \
  results, latest changes tables and build queues.</p>\
  <p>Content refreshing reloads the changing portion of the page at regular intervals, and does not affect static \
  pages.  To enable refreshing, check this option.</p>

refreshInterval.label=content refresh interval (seconds)
refreshInterval.verbose=Time between consecutive refreshes of live content.  To reduce unneccessary load on the pulse \
  server, it is best to set refresh intervals to 30 seconds or longer.

tailLines.label=log tail max lines
tailLines.verbose=Sets the number of lines displayed in the build and recipe log views.

tailRefreshInterval.label=log tail refresh interval (seconds)
tailRefreshInterval.verbose=Sets the number of seconds between refreshes of the build and recipe log views.

defaultTimestampDisplay.label=default timestamp display
defaultTimestampDisplay.verbose=<p>Controls how timestamps are displayed by default.  Note that you can toggle between \
  displays whenever you like using the small calendar icon displayed before each timestamp.  Two options are \
  available:</p>\
  <ol>\
    <li>absolute: show the timestamp as the date and time, e.g. 3/23/12 5:21:05 PM EST</li>\
    <li>relative: show the time that has elapsed since the timestamp, e.g. 2 days 5 hours ago</li>
  </ol>\
  <p>Generally relative timestamps give a good perspective, however some users may prefer to see actual times by \
  default.</p>
