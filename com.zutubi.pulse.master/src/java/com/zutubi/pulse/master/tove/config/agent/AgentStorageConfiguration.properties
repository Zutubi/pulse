label.template=agent template
introduction=An agent is a server that can be used to execute builds.
verbose=<p>Builds performed by your pulse server are executed by dispatching recipes to agents.\
  Your pulse server has its own built-in agent by default, known as the master agent. You can also \
  run agents on other hosts, known as remote agents.</p>\
  <p>Note that it is possible to run multiple agents on the same host, including multiple master \
  agents.  To do so, use the same host and port settings for multiple agents (preferrably in a \
  common template, which you can also use to manage other common settings).  Pulse will \
  automatically recognise that the agents share a host and will manage the host appropriately.</p>

dataDirectory.label=data directory pattern
dataDirectory.verbose=<p>Specifies a pattern for the directory under which to store agent data.  \
  This directory is used as a working area for running recipes.  It should normally be underneath \
  the host''s data directory.  The pattern may include the following properties:</p>\
  <ul>\
    <li>data.dir: the data directory for the pulse installation on the agent''s host</li>\
    <li>agent: the name of the agent, encoded to form a valid file name</li>\
    <li>agent.handle: a unique id for the agent</li>\
  </ul>\
  <p>We recommend leaving the data directory pattern at the default unless it causes a problem.  \
  If a custom pattern is used, it should include $'{'agent'}' or $'{'agent.handle'}' to ensure a \
  different directory for each agent.</p>

outsideCleanupAllowed.label=allow cleanup outside data directory
outsideCleanupAllowed.verbose=Normally, pulse will not clean up directories outside of the data \
  directory, even if projects have been configured to use such directories. This helps defend \
  against accidental deletion of files not controlled by pulse. Turn on this option to allow \
  cleanup anywhere on the disk.

diskSpaceThresholdEnabled.label=enable free disk threshold
diskSpaceThresholdEnabled.verbose=If checked, pulse will ensure this agent has at least the \
  configured amount of disk space free before using the agent for a build. Free disk space \
  is measured on the volume where the data directory resides.

diskSpaceThresholdMib.label=free disk space threshold (MiB)
diskSpaceThresholdMib.verbose=Minimum free disk space required for pulse to assign a build \
  stage to this agent, in Mebibytes (1MiB = 1024 x 1024 bytes).  If the agent has less available \
  space it will enter the ''low disk space'' state and remain unavailable until the problem is \
  resolved.
