  be numerical.

  field string to a number.

useCustomColour.label=use custom colour

  the report.  If not, a colour will be chosen automatically.

customColour.verbose=Specifies a custom colour for displaying the series.  Colours may be \
  specified as simple names (see the constant fields \
  of <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html">java.awt.Color</a>), or \
  as a numerical RGB value.  Numerical values are expressed most easily in hexidecimal form, by \
  prefixing with 0x and using six hexidecimal digits.
