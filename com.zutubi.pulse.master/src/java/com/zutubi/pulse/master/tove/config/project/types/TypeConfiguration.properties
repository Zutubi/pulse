label=project type
introduction=The project type defines how the project is built and what artifacts are captured.
verbose=<p>Pulse supports multiple types of projects. These project types fall into two categories:\
  <ol>\
    <li>\
      <strong>Built-in projects</strong>: Projects that use directly-supported build tools \
      and are completely configured via the web interface. These projects are the easiest to \
      configure, and are a great way to start using your pulse server.\
    </li>\
    <li>\
      <strong>Pulse file projects</strong>: Projects that have their recipes described by \
      pulse files. These are the most flexible projects, and although they take more intial \
      effort to configure, offer advantages over built-in projects.\
    </li>\
  </ol>\
  </p><p>\
  For more information, particularly on creating pulse files, refer to the manual.\
