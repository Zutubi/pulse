introduction=Pulse is able to authenticate users against an existing LDAP server. To authenticate against \
  LDAP, provide the details required to connect to your LDAP server and an LDAP filter to identify users.
verbose=<p>Pulse is able to optionally authenticate users against an existing LDAP server. To authenticate against \
  LDAP, provide the details required to connect to your LDAP server and an LDAP filter to identify users. You may then \
  add users that are authenticated via LDAP rather than pulse passwords. Using the &quot;auto add new users&quot; \
  option you can also allow new pulse users to be created for usernames authenticated successfully via LDAP.</p>\
  <p>You can also, optionally, integrate the groups defined within your LDAP directory. By creating groups with \
  matching names in your pulse server, and configuring group details appropriately, users can be automatically granted \
  pulse group membership based on their LDAP group membership. Users added to pulse groups in this way will inherit \
  the authorities granted to that pulse group. They will not, however, be added as members of the pulse group \
  permanently (and thus will not show up as members in the pulse interface). Instead, their membership is reevaluated \
  each time they log in, to keep pulse in sync with changes to the LDAP directory.</p>

enabled.label=enable ldap integration
enabled.verbose=Check this box to enable LDAP authentication for your pulse server.

ldapUrl.label=ldap host url
ldapUrl.verbose=The URL of the LDAP host, including the port to connect to.
ldapUrl.example.1=ldap://ldap.example.com:389/

baseDn.label=base dn
baseDn.verbose=The base distinguished name under which to search for users.
baseDn.example.1=dc=example,dc=com

managerDn.label=manager dn
managerDn.help=manager dn for initial bind, leave blank to bind anonymously
managerDn.verbose=Distinguished name for the manager account if required for initial binding. Required when your LDAP \
  server does not allow anonymous binding.
managerDn.example.1=cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com

managerPassword.label=manager password
managerPassword.help=password for manager bind
managerPassword.verbose=The password for the manager account, only used when a manager dn is provided.

userBaseDn.label=user base dn
userBaseDn.help=dn, relative to the base dn, under which to search for users
userBaseDn.verbose=Distinguished name, relative to the base distinguished name, under which to search for users. If \
  left blank, the search begins from the base distinguished name, which will usually work (but may place unnecessary \
  load on the LDAP server). For some Active Directory servers this setting may be necessary.
userBase.example.1=ou=users

userFilter.label=user filter
userFilter.help=filter to use when searching for users, variable $'{login}' expands to provided login
userFilter.verbose=An LDAP filter used to locate the user matching the login name provided by the user to pulse. This \
  login name may be referred to in the filter by using the $'{login}' variable.
userFilter.example.1=(uid=$'{login}')
userFilter.example.1.blurb=A typical, simple search
userFilter.example.2=(sAMAccountName=$'{login}')
userFilter.example.2.blurb=Typical active directory search
userFilter.example.3=(&(uid=$'{login}')(group=developers))
userFilter.example.3.blurb=A search restricted to users in the &quot;developers&quot; group

autoAddUsers.label=auto add new users
autoAddUsers.help=if checked, users that do not exist will be automatically added if they are successfully \
  authenticated via ldap
autoAddUsers.verbose=If checked, users that are successfully authenticated via LDAP can be automatically added to \
  pulse. When a user provides a login that does not exist in pulse, authentication against LDAP will be attempted. If \
  the authentication is successful, the user will be added to pulse automatically, to be authenticated via LDAP. Pulse \
  will attempt to retrieve the user''s full name from the LDAP server.

emailAttribute.label=email attribute
emailAttribute.help=if set, when users are automatically created (via auto add), an email contact point will be added \
  based on this attribute
emailAttribute.verbose=<p>If set, this value is used as the name of an attribute in the user records that contains the \
  user''s email address. When a user is added via the auto-add mechanism, the value of this attribute will be used \
  to create an email contact point for the user.</p>\
  <p>If this value is not set no contact point will be created for auto added users.</p>

groupBaseDns.label=group base dns
groupBaseDns.help=a collection of dns, relative to the base dn, under which to search for groups (if none are \
  specified, group integration is disabled)
groupBaseDns.verbose=A collection of distinguished names of subtrees under which to search for LDAP groups, \
  <strong>relative to the base dn</strong> configured above. Adding one or more values will enable group integration.
groupBaseDns.example.1=ou=groups

groupSearchFilter.label=group search filter
groupSearchFitler.help=used to find a users groups, variables $'{user.dn}' and $'{login}' are available, defaults to \
  (member=$'{user.dn}')
groupSearchFilter.verbose=Filter used to search under the group base dn for groups that a user is a member of. To \
  refer to the user, use the variable $'{login}' for their pulse/LDAP login name, or $'{user.dn}' for their full \
  distinguished name in the LDAP directory. This filter identifies the LDAP groups the user is a member of, which will \
  result in the user being automatically added to groups of the same name within pulse, where such groups exist. The \
  name of the LDAP group is derived using the group name attribute (see below).
groupSearchFilter.example.1=(member=$'{user.dn}')
groupSearchFilter.example.1.blurb=The default value

groupRoleAttribute.label=group name attribute
groupRoleAttribute.help=name of the ldap attribute that contains the name of a group, defaults to cn
groupRoleAttribute.verbose=The LDAP attribute that holds the name of a group. When a group is found via the group \
  search, it''s name is extracted by looking at the value of this attribute. This name is then used to find any \
  matching pulse group.
groupRoleAttribute.example.1=cn
groupRoleAttribute.example.1.blurb=The default value

searchGroupSubtree.label=search group subtrees
searchGroupSubtree.help=if checked, the group search will operate over the entire subtree (by default only one level \
  is searched)
searchGroupSubtree.verbose=By default, groups are only searched for directly under the group base dn. To search the \
  entire subtree under this dn recursively, check this option.

followReferrals.label=follow referrals
followReferrals.help=if checked, referrals returned by the ldap server will be automatically followed
followReferrals.verbose=<p>If checked, pulse will automatically follow any referrals returned by the LDAP server. This \
  setting is usually unnecessary, as referrals are not usually returned. It is most-commonly required for Active \
  Directory.</p>\
  <p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you receive LDAP error messages including references to \
  javax.naming.PartialResultException, try checking this option.</p>

escapeSpaceCharacters.label=escape space characters
escapeSpaceCharacters.help=if checked, spaces will be escaped in the dn values
escapeSpaceCharacters.verbose=If checked, spaces within distinguished name values will be escaped by pulse. Uncheck \
  this value or escape spaces manually if your LDAP server requires non-standard escaping.
