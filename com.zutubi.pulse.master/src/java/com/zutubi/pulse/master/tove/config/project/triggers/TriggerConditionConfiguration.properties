label=trigger condition
introduction=Trigger conditions allow you to filter out unwanted trigger firing.
verbose=Conditions give you more finely-grained control over when a trigger fires.  For example, \
  you may like to build once a day, but only if there are new, unbuilt changes.  This latter \
  condition can be added to a cron trigger to achieve the desired effect.
