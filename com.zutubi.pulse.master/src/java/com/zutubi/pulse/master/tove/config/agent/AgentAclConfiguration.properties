label=agent acl
introduction=Agent ACLs are used to grant agent permissions to user groups.
verbose=Agent ACLs are used to grant agent permissions to user groups.  They are used to \
  control visibility of agents, as well as the ability to change their configuration and perform \
  actions such as disabling the agent.  Note that the ability to create and delete agents is \
  controlled by a separate server-level permission.

group.label=group
group.verbose=The user group to assign permissions to.

allowedActions.label=allowed actions
allowedActions.verbose=The list of actions that the given user group has permission to perform. \
  Some actions have special behaviour:\
  <ul>\
    <li><strong>administer</strong>: A &quot;super&quot; privilege that grants the group \
        permission to perform all actions.</li>\
    <li><strong>view</strong>: Allows the group to view the agent and its configuration.  Note \
        that if a group can view an agent, this implies that group can also view all of its \
        template ancestors (whether granted permission on those ancestors or not).  The view \
        permission is effectively &quot;reverse inherited&quot;.</li>\
    <li><strong>write</strong>: Allows the group to edit the agent configuration.</li>\
  </ul>\
  The remaining actions are self-explanatory.
