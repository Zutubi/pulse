introduction=Project ACLs are used to grant project permissions to user groups.
verbose=Project ACLs are used to grant project permissions to user groups.  They are used to \
  control visibility of projects, as well as the ability to change their configuration and perform \
  actions such as triggering builds.  Note that the ability to create and delete projects is \
  controlled by a separate server-level permission.

group.label=group
group.verbose=The user group to assign permissions to.

allowedActions.label=allowed actions
allowedActions.verbose=The list of actions that the given user group has permission to perform. \
  Some actions have special behaviour:\
  <ul>\
    <li><strong>administer</strong>: A &quot;super&quot; privilege that grants the group \
        permission to perform all actions.</li>\
    <li><strong>view</strong>: Allows the group to view the project and its configuration.  Note \
        that if a group can view a project, this implies that group can also view all of its \
        template ancestors (whether granted permission on those ancestors or not).  The view \
        permission is effectively &quot;reverse inherited&quot;.</li>\
    <li><strong>write</strong>: Allows the group to edit the project configuration.</li>\
    <li><strong>view source</strong>: Allows the group to view working copy snapshots, if they\
        are captured with build results.</li>\
  </ul>\
  The remaining actions are self-explanatory.
