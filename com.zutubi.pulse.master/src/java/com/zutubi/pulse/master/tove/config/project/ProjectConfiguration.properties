label=project
introduction=A project describes how to run a specific type of build.
verbose=A project in pulse is analogous to a single code line for a software project. For each \
  code line that you want to automatically build and test, you should add a new project to your \
  pulse server. Simple software projects may have just one code line, but most projects consist \
  of multiple code lines, commonly represented as branches in the project''s SCM. Projects \
  are at the core of pulse; when using your pulse server you will be mostly concerned with \
  viewing and managing projects and builds of those projects.
