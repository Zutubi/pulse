label=dependency
introduction=A dependency defines that this project depends upon another project'''s publications to be able \
  to build successfully.  The retrieved publications can be further customised by specifying the \
  revision and / or stage of the other project.

project.label=project
project.verbose=The dependent project whose publications will be retrieved during a build.

revision.label=revision
revision.verbose=The revision of the project that this dependency is referring to.  By default, this is  \
  set to <code>latest.integration</code>, which indicates that the publications from the latest successful \
  build should be retrieved.  Alternatively, you can specify a specific build number in the revision field if \
  you wish to tie the dependency to a fixed revision.  For instance, if you want to retrieve the publications  \
  from build 13, then you would specify <code>13</code>.

transitive.label=transitive
transitive.verbose=Marking this dependency as transitive indicates that this dependency'''s own \
  dependencies will be resolved when this dependency is resolved.  For example, project A depends on \
  project B and project B depends on project C.  If we mark project A'''s dependency on project B as \
  transitive, then project C'''s publications will be retrieved to project A'''s build.  If the dependency\
  is not marked as transitive, then those publications will not be retrieved to project A'''s build.

allStages.label=all stages
allStages.verbose=Checking this checkbox will indicate that all stage pulblications should be retrieved by \
  this dependency

stages.label=stages
stages.verbose=This is a comma separated list of stage names indicating which stages publications should \
  be retrieved by this dependency
