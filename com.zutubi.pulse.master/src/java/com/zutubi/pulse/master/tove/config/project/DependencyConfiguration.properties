label=dependency
introduction=A dependency defines that this project depends upon another project''s artifacts to be able \
  to build successfully.  The retrieved artifacts can be further customised by specifying the \
  revision and / or stage of the dependent project.

projectName.label=project
project.label=project
project.verbose=The dependent project whose artifacts will be retrieved during a build.
project.circular.error=circular dependency detected via: {1}

revision.label=revision
revision.verbose=The revision of the project that this dependency is referring to.  By default, this is  \
  set to <code>latest.integration</code>, which indicates that the artifacts from the latest successful \
  build should be retrieved.  Selecting <code>latest.milestone</code> is similar with the exception that only \
  successful builds with a status of milestone or release are considered.  For <code>latest.release</code> \
  only builds with a status of release are considered.  \
  <p>Alternatively, you can specify a specific build number (or any other fixed revision) \
  by selecting custom and entering the build number (or revision) into the custom revision field.</p>

customRevision.label=custom revision
customRevision.verbose=The custom revision field allows you to specify a specific revision for this dependency

transitive.label=transitive
transitive.verbose=Marking this dependency as transitive indicates that this dependency''s own \
  dependencies will be resolved when this dependency is resolved.  For example, project A depends on \
  project B and project B depends on project C.  If we mark project A''s dependency on project B as \
  transitive, then project C''s artifacts will be retrieved to project A''s build.  If the dependency \
  is not marked as transitive, then those artifacts will not be retrieved to project A''s build.

stageType.label=retrieve stages
stageType.verbose=Indicates which stages of the upstrem project artifacts should be retrieved \
  from.  Three options are available:\
  <ul>\
      <li>all stages: stages of this project retrieve artifacts published by all stages of the \
          upstream project</li>\
      <li>corresponding stages: stages of this project retrieve artifacts only from an upstream \
          stage with the same name (if one exists)</li>\
      <li>selected stages: stages of this project retrieve artifacts only from the upstream stages \
          specifically selected below</li>\
  </ul>\
  In the all and selected stages cases every stage in this project retrieves the same artifacts.  \
  In the corresponding stages case, the upstream artifacts retrieved depends on the name of the \
  stage performing the retrieval.

stages.label=stages
stages.verbose=The list of stages of the required project that this project depends upon.  Artifacts \
  from these stages in the required project will be retrieved by all stages in this project.
