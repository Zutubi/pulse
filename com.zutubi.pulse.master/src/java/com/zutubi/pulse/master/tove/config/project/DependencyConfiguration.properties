label=dependency
introduction=A dependency defines that this project depends upon another project''s publications to be able \
  to build successfully.  The retrieved publications can be further customised by specifying the \
  revision and / or stage of the other project.

module.label=project
project.label=project
project.verbose=The dependent project whose publications will be retrieved during a build.

revision.label=revision
revision.verbose=The revision of the project that this dependency is referring to.  By default, this is  \
  set to <code>latest.integration</code>, which indicates that the publications from the latest successful \
  build should be retrieved.  Alternatively, you can specify a specific build number in the revision field if \
  you wish to tie the dependency to a fixed revision.  For instance, if you want to retrieve the publications  \
  from build 13, then you would specify <code>13</code>.

transitive.label=transitive
transitive.verbose=Marking this dependency as transitive indicates that this dependency''s own \
  dependencies will be resolved when this dependency is resolved.  For example, project A depends on \
  project B and project B depends on project C.  If we mark project A''s dependency on project B as \
  transitive, then project C''s publications will be retrieved to project A''s build.  If the dependency\
  is not marked as transitive, then those publications will not be retrieved to project A''s build.

allStages.label=all stages
allStages.verbose=If checked, this project depends on all stages of the required project.  Publications \
  from all stages in the required project will be retrieved by builds in this project.

stages.label=stages
stages.verbose=The list of stages of the required project that this project depends upon.  Publications \
  from these stages in the required project will be retrieved by builds in this project.
