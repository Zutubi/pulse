label=dependency
introduction=A dependency defines that this project depends upon another project''s artifacts to be able \
  to build successfully.  The retrieved artifacts can be further customised by specifying the \
  revision and / or stage of the dependent project.

module.label=project
project.label=project
project.verbose=The dependent project whose artifacts will be retrieved during a build.

revision.label=revision
revision.verbose=The revision of the project that this dependency is referring to.  By default, this is  \
  set to <code>latest.integration</code>, which indicates that the artifacts from the latest successful \
  build should be retrieved.  Selecting <code>latest.milestone</code> is similar with the exception that only \
  successful builds with a status of milestone or release are considered.  For <code>latest.release</code> \
  only builds with a status of release are considered.  \
  <p>\
  Alternatively, you can specify a specific build number (or any other fixed revision) \
  by selecting custom and entering the build number (or revision) into the custom revision field.

customRevision.label=custom revision
customRevision.verbose=The custom revision field allows you to specify a specific revision for this dependency

transitive.label=transitive
transitive.verbose=Marking this dependency as transitive indicates that this dependency''s own \
  dependencies will be resolved when this dependency is resolved.  For example, project A depends on \
  project B and project B depends on project C.  If we mark project A''s dependency on project B as \
  transitive, then project C''s artifacts will be retrieved to project A''s build.  If the dependency\
  is not marked as transitive, then those artifacts will not be retrieved to project A''s build.

allStages.label=all stages
allStages.verbose=If checked, this project depends on all stages of the required project.  Artifacts \
  from all stages in the required project will be retrieved by builds in this project.

stages.label=stages
stages.verbose=The list of stages of the required project that this project depends upon.  Artifacts \
  from these stages in the required project will be retrieved by builds in this project.
