  build
propagateStatus.verbose=If checked, the status is propagated from the completed to the triggered \
  build.  That is, the triggered build will use the same status as the build it is dependent on. \
  This can be used to ensure a cascade of dependent builds all use the same status.

propagateVersion.help=if checked, the version of the completed build will be used for the triggered \
  build
propagateVersion.verbose=If checked, the version is propagated from the completed to the triggered \
