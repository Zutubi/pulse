label=dependent build trigger
introduction=Dependent build triggers fire when a project that this project depends upon is built.
verbose=Dependent build triggers fire when a project that this project depends upon is built.  The \
  trigger will only fire if the upstream build is successful.

propagateStatus.label=progagate status
propagateStatus.help=if checked, the status of the completed build will be used for the triggered \
  build
propagateStatus.verbose=If checked, the status is propagated from the completed to the triggered \
  build.  That is, the triggered build will use the same status as the build it is dependent on. \
  This can be used to ensure a cascade of dependent builds all use the same status.

propagateVersion.label=propagate version
propagateVersion.help=if checked, the version of the completed build will be used for the triggered \
  build
propagateVersion.verbose=If checked, the version is propagated from the completed to the triggered \
  build.  That is, the triggered build will use the same version as the build it is dependent on. \
  This can be used to ensure a cascade of dependent builds all use the same version.\

propagateRevision.label=propagate revision
propagateRevision.help=if checked, the revision of the completed build will be used for the triggered \
  build
propagateRevision.verbose=If checked, the revision is propagated from the completed to the triggered \
  build.  This is useful if you want the same SCM revision to be used across related builds, but only \
  makes sense if that revision spans the source of both builds.
