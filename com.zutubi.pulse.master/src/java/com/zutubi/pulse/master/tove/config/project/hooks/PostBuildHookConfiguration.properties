label=post build hook
introduction=A post build hook is used to run a task when a build is complete.

# Form fields
runForAll.label=run for all builds
runForAll.verbose=If checked, the task will be run after every build, regardless of the build \
  status.

runForStates.label=run for builds with states
runForStates.help=the task will only run for builds that finish in the selected states 

runTaskOnAgents.label=run task on agent
runTaskOnAgents.verbose=If checked, the task for this hook will be run on an agent that participated in the build \
  (normally all hook tasks are run on the master).  The agent is selected by searching all stages in their configured \
  order for the first stage to use an agent (stages that are skipped or fail very early do not use an agent).  This \
  option does not apply to all tasks, but does apply to the run executable task.
