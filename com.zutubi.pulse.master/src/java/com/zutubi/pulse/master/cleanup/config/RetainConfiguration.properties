label=retain rule
introduction=Retain rules allow you to exclude builds from all of your cleanup rules.  Any build \
  that matches any retain rule is immune from cleanup.
verbose=Retain rules are the inverse of cleanup rules.  They may be used to define a set of \
  builds that should be excluded from the cleanup process.  Any build that matches any one of \
  your project''s retain builds will be excluded from the clean process.  Retain rules are useful \
  for ensuring a minimal number of builds are always kept (e.g. the latest 5 successful builds) \
  despite those builds being old enough to normally be cleaned up.

retain.label=retain builds for up to
retain.verbose=Specifies the range of builds that should be excluded from cleanup.  The range \
  can be measured as a count of builds or of days.  The range is applied after builds are limited \
  based on the state and/or maturity.
