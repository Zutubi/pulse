label=remove rule
introduction=Remove rules allow you to define which builds are removed and after how long.  This \
  helps to manage disk space resources for your server.
verbose=Project remove rules are used to define when historical build data is cleaned from the \
  pulse host server. In a perfect world, the host would have enough disk space to retain all \
  project build data forever. However, disk space is limited, and project data  may consume hundreds \
  of megabytes or more per build. Cleanup rules provide a flexible way of defining when data should \
  be cleaned to preserve disk space.

cleanupAll.label=clean up everything
cleanupAll.verbose=Indicates that everything about the build, including database records and artifacts, \
  should be cleaned up.  The end result is that all record of this build will be removed.

what.label=clean up selected items
what.verbose=Indicates what will be cleaned from builds.  \
  <ul>\
    <li>build artifacts: refers to all artifacts captured by the build (excluding published copies)</li> \
    <li>logs: refers to the logs that contain the output from the build process</li> \
    <li>repository artifacts: refers to files that have been published to the internal artifact \
        repository</li>\
  </ul>

retain.label=retain builds for up to
retain.verbose=Specifies how long results that match the rule should be retained for. The duration \
  is specified in terms of a number of build results or a number of days. If a number of results \
  is given, at most that many results will be retained, and if there are excess the oldest results \
  will be cleaned. If a number of days is given, results more than that number of days old will be \
  cleaned.  Not this duration is applied after any filtering by state and/or maturity.
