label=cleanup rule
introduction=Cleanup rules allow you to define which builds are retained and for how long.  This \
  helps to manage disk space resources for your server.
verbose=Project cleanup rules are used to define when historical build data is cleaned from the \
  pulse host server. In a perfect world, the host would have enough disk space to retain all \
  project build data forever. However, disk space is limited, and project data (particularly \
  working directories) may consume hundreds of megabytes or more per build. Cleanup rules provide \
  a flexible way of defining when data should be cleaned to preserve disk space.

name.label=name
name.verbose=A descriptive name for the rule.

what.label=what
what.verbose=Indicates what will be cleaned from matching builds when this rule triggers.  Whole \
  builds will remove all trace of the build from pulse, build artifacts will remove artifacts \
  retained from the build, whereas working directories only will  just remove working copy snapshots \
  (which tend to be large).

states.label=builds with state(s)
states.help=only builds in the specified states will be cleaned up
states.verbose=You may optionally choose to restrict the cleanup rule to apply to builds that \
  completed with one of a specified set of states. If no states are selected, the rule applies to \
  all builds. If one or more states are chosen, the rule applies only to results that completed in \
  that set of states.

statuses.label=builds with status(es)
statuses.help=only builds with the specified statuses will be cleaned up
statuses.verbose=You may optionally choose to restrict the cleanup rule to apply to builds that \
  have a particular status.  If no statuses are selected, the rule applies to all builds.  If \
  one or more statuses are chosen, the rule applies only to results that have the selected statuses.

retain.label=retain builds for up to
retain.verbose=Specifies how long results that match the rule should be retained for. The duration \
  is specified in terms of a number of build results or a number of days. If a number of results \
  is given, at most that many results will be retained, and if there are excess the oldest results \
  will be cleaned. If a number of days is given, results more than that number of days old will be \
  cleaned.

unit.label=retain units
unit.verbose=Units for the retain field.  As described for that field, builds can be matched in \
  terms of number of results or number of days.
