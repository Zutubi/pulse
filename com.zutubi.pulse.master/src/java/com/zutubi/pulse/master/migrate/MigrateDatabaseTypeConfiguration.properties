database.type.blurb.heading=Which database?
database.type.blurb=Pulse supports both an embedded database and external databases.  Using an embedded database is \
the easiest option and is suitable for evaluation purposes.  However, we recommend an external \
database is used in production.  You can migrate between databases after your evaluation (see the \
online documentation for details).
