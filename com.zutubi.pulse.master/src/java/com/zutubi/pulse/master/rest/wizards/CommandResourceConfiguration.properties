addDefaultResource.label=add resource requirement
addDefaultResource.help=check to add a project-level requirement for a resource matching the new command
addDefaultResource.verbose=If checked, a resource requirement matching this new command will be \
  automatically added to your project.  This step is provided when Pulse detects that an \
  appropriate resource is available and not yet required by the project.  Generally adding the \
  requirement is a good idea as it helps match builds to capable agents, and ensures \
  resource-related properties (such as binary paths) are added to the context of the command.

resource.label=resource
resource.browse=browse
resource.verbose=The name of the resource which is required.  This field may include references \
  to properties available to the stage that the requirement applies to.  Generally you don''t \
  want to change this as Pulse has set it for you to match the command type.

defaultVersion.label=use default version
defaultVersion.verbose=If checked, the default version of the resource is required. Otherwise \
  you must choose a specific version.

version.label=version
version.verbose=A specific version of the resource which is required.  This field may include \
  references to properties available to the stage that the requirement applies to.

optional.label=optional
optional.verbose=If checked, the resource requirement is optional.  The resource will be imported \
  if it exists, but no error is raised if it does not exist.  Agents without the resource are \
  still considered capable of building the recipe.
