INITIAL.description=The agent is enabled but has not yet been pinged to determine its status.
VERSION_MISMATCH.description=The agent build number does not match the master build number.  The \
  master will attempt to upgrade it automatically.
PLUGIN_MISMATCH.description=The agent''s host either has no plugins (new install) or has different \
  plugins that require a reboot to synchronise with the master.  The master will attempt to \
  synchronise the plugins and reboot the agent.
TOKEN_MISMATCH.description=The agent''s security token does not match the master''s token.  To fix \
  this you can manually delete the agent''s service.token file.
INVALID_MASTER.description=The agent is contactable, but cannot itself contact the master.  The \
  most common cause of this is an incorrect ''master host'' value under administration > settings.
SYNCHRONISING.description=The agent has just become idle and its state is being synchronised \
  before it is made available for builds.  Pending synchronisation messages are sent at this time.
SYNCHRONISED.description=The agent has been synchronised and is ready to be made available, \
  subject to a successful ping.
RECIPE_ASSIGNED.description=A recipe has been assigned to the agent, but it has not yet commenced.
POST_RECIPE.description=The agent has completed a recipe and is running post-recipe tasks.
AWAITING_PING.description=The master is waiting for the first successful ping of the agent after \
  a recipe.
BUILDING_INVALID.description=The agent has indicated it is building a recipe that the master is \
  not expecting.  The master will attempt to remedy this by telling the agent to terminate the \
  recipe.
LOW_DISK_SPACE.description=The agent is idle but has low free disk space so is not available for \
  builds.  Refer to the agent''s storage settings.
