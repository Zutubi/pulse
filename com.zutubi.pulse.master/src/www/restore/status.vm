            <h3>Records</h3>
            <p>The records restore task imports the systems configuration into the 2.0 record storage system. This
            data includes, amongst other things, your project and user configuration.</p>
            <h3>Database</h3>
            <p>The database restoration imports the Pulse runtime data into your selected database.  Depending on
            the amount of runtime data, this may take from several seconds to tens of minutes.</p>
            <p>The status message for the database restoration will give you an indication of which table is being
            imported, and in the case of very large tables, what row it is up to.</p>
            <h3>Custom Configuration</h3>
            <p>This task will restore any custom templates that you may have stored in the $PULSE_DATA/config
            directory.</p>
            <h3>Artifacts</h3>
            <p>This task will run only if you have chosen to import the artifacts from your previous installation.
            Since the directory layout has changed slightly between 1.2.x and 2.0, this task will reorganise your artifacts
            accordingly.  Depending on the number of directories that need to be moved, this may take some time.</p>
