                and shows more information about builds running on agents.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("agentstatus" "agent status tab" "accept" false)
            <td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("activity" "server activity tab" "accept" false)
            <td>
                The server activity tab has been overhauled to show more information in

                under the builds they are part of.

                The server and agent info and messages tabs have also been restyled to

        <tr>

        <tr>
            #actionHeader("templatedfields" "templated field actions" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Overridden configuration values are now easier to revert, and it is also
                easier to navigate to where an inherited configuration value is defined.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("introduceparent" "introduce parent refactoring" "accept" false)
            <td>
                The templated configuration system now supports a new introduce parent
                refactoring.  This allows you to adjust your hierarchy over time to take
                full advantage of templates.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("pluggablediscovery" "pluggable resource discovery" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Automatic tool discovery and configuration is now pluggable, so if you use a tool
                not yet supported by Pulse you can choose to add support yourself.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("more" "and more..." "accept" false)
