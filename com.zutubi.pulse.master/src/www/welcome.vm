        Welcome to Pulse 3.0 Beta!  This is an early access release that is unpolished and expected to be unstable.
        We've released it early to solicit feedback from customers that are interested in the brand new administration
        UI.  Highlights of the new UI include:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style: circle; width: 720px">
        <li>An all-new HTML5-based implementation.</li>
        <li>Integration with browser history for more convenient navigation.</li>
        <li>A new navigation bar that is used throughout the UI (not just for admin) to save vertical space and match
            the new admin styling.</li>
        <li>New project and agent overview pages, showing important configuration at a glance.</li>
        <li>A hierarchy navigator that allows you to easily jump from one project (or agent) to the next,
            maintaining your relative location in the configuration.</li>
        <li>The ability to filter hierarchy trees to easily find a project or agent in a large installation.</li>
        <li>Improved template decoration of forms, making them less busy so important info is easier to spot.</li>
        <li>Drag and drop reordering of collections.</li>
        <li>Better visibility of defined, inherited and overriden collection orders, with easy reversion.</li>
        <li>A simpler three-column layout where the main pane no longer includes an extra context column.</li>
        <li>New multi-select and string list widgets that are more compact and usable.</li>
        <li>More obvious access to built in documentation for forms.</li>
        <li>All based on a new HTTP-based API that is more efficient (it will become publicly accessible in
            a future major.minor release).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Testing has been mainly done in Chrome, with light workouts in other browsers.  Compatibility will be tested
        with IE 10+, Safari and Firefox for the final release.  All bug reports and feedback are most welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
        This release also includes major library and framework upgrades under the hood, which you should only notice in
        the form of improved performance and future-proofing.
