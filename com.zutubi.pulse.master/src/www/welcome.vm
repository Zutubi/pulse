    <h1> :: what's new :: </h1>
    <p>
        Pulse 2.3 is packed with new features, with a major focus on both build throughput and the
        user interface.  Among the most important updates are:
    </p>
    <table class="template-actions" cellspacing="5px" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <tr>
            <th class="category" colspan="2">new in 2.3</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("concurrent" "concurrent project builds" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Pulse can now run multiple builds of the same project in parallel.  The maximum
                number of concurrent builds for a project is controlled by a new build option.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("priorities" "project and stage priorities" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Projects (or individual build stages) may now be assigned priorities, controlling
                how they are scheduled.  Higher priority stages take precedence in the queue.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("home" "project home tab" "accept" false)
            <td>
                The project home tab has been overhauled to show key information about project
                health and activity more prominently.  Featured artifacts from the latest build are
                now shown in the right column.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("history" "project history tab" "accept" false)
            <td>
                The project history tab has been reworked, with a new build summary table that
                shows more information.  The table is also more easily customised than before.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("summary" "build summary tab" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Building on changes in Pulse 2.2, the build summary tab has been further improved.
                As with the project home tab, key build status is now more obvious.  More
                information is also displayed for each build stage.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("mybuilds" "my builds tab" "accept" false)
            <td>
                The my builds tab, which displays personal builds, has been restyled.  Similar to
                the history tab, a new build summary table is used with superior customisability. 
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("sync" "plugin synchronisation" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Plugins are now automatically synchronised among all of your Pulse installations.
                When a plugin is installed on the master, it is automatically deployed to agents,
                and even to tool installs on developer machines.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("disable" "stage/command disabling" "accept" false)
            <td>
                All build stages and commands now have an "enabled" flag.  You can toggle this flag
                to temporarily disable the stage or command without losing its configuration.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("term" "terminated status" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Builds that are explicitly killed by a user or timeout now finish in a distinct
                "terminated" state.  This allows them to be differentiated from other build errors.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("uiperf" "ui performance" "accept" false)
            <td>
                The most important live views in the Pulse web UI have been updated to use less
                bandwidth when refreshing.  Pulse JavaScript has also been repackaged to save space.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("more" "and more..." "accept" false)
            <td>
                This release also includes numerous smaller improvements and fixes.  Notably,
                significant libraries in the Pulse server have also been updated in this release.
            </td>
