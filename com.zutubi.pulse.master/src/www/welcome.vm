        Welcome to Pulse 3.0 Alpha!  This is an early access release that is thoroughly incomplete, unstable and
        unpolished.  We've released it early to solicit feedback from customers that are interested in the brand
        new administration UI.  Highlights of the new UI include:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style: circle; width: 720px">
        <li>An all-new HTML5-based implementation.</li>
        <li>Integration with browser history for more convenient navigation.</li>
        <li>New project and agent overview pages, showing important configuration at a glance. (Note these are
            far from complete at this stage.)</li>
        <li>A hierarchy navigator that allows you to easily jump from one project (or agent) to the next,
            maintaining your relative location in the configuration.</li>
        <li>The ability to filter hierarchy trees to easily find a project or agent in a large installation.</li>
        <li>New multi-select and string list widgets that are more compact and usable.</li>
        <li>Drag and drop reordering of collections.</li>
        <li>All based on a new HTTP-based API that is more efficient (it will become publicly accessible in
            a future major.minor release).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Major missing pieces include:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style: circle; width: 720px">
        <li>Template decoration of forms (showing what is inherited/overridden and from where).</li>
        <li>Field actions (e.g. browsing for files).</li>
        <li>Plugin administration.</li>
        <li>Styling, polish, testing, ...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The styling is also clunky and poorly linked relative to the existing UI, the links between them
        will be overhauled before final release.  We may decide to keep somewhat distinct theming for the
        administration section as it does give a sense of context (a serendipitous discovery as part of
        these changes).
