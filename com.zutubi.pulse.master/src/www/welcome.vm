    <h1> :: what's new :: </h1>
    <p>
        Pulse 2.1 has several new features.  Among the most important are:
    </p>
    <p>
        <table class="template-actions" cellspacing="5px" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
            <tr>
                <th class="category" colspan="2">new in 2.1</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                #actionHeader("project.dependecies" "project dependencies" "accept" false)
                <td>
                    Pulse now boasts project dependency management, allowing you to declare
                    dependencies between your projects and deliver built artifacts between them.
                    Smarter triggering has also been added for dependent projects.  Dependency
                    support is built on Apache Ivy, making it interoperable with Maven and Ivy
                    repositories, and with projects that already use Ivy.  Pulse can act as an Ivy
                    repository both for internal projects and external ones.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                #actionHeader("multi.command.projects" "multi-command projects" "accept" false)
                <td>
                    Pulse has always allowed a build to consist of multiple steps, but in previous
                    versions to access this flexibility you had to write a Pulse file by hand.  Now
                    there is full UI support for configuring multi-command projects, and the full
                    flexibility of all the commands has also been exposed in the UI.  You can still
                    write your Pulse files by hand, and in fact they have been simplified in some
                    ways.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                #actionHeader("personal.build.improvements" "personal build improvements" "accept" false)
                <td>
                    Several improvements have been made to personal builds, including:
                    <ul class="points">
                        <li>The ability to choose the revision for the build.</li>
                        <li>No more forced update when requesting a personal build.</li>
                        <li>Pluggable patch formats: including support for standard unified diffs.</li>
                        <li>The ability to submit an existing patch file (in any supported format).</li>
                        <li>Smarter internal patch format and application.</li>
                    </ul>
                    These improvements make requesting personal builds more flexible and
                    interoperable.  For example, you can create patches with other tools and submit
                    them directly to Pulse.
                </td>
            </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("multiple.agents.per.host" "multiple agents per host" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Pulse now directly supports running multiple agents on the same host, including the
                ability to run multiple master agents.  This allows you to make full use of high
                end hardware with just a single Pulse service installed on a machine.  To make use
                of this ability, configure multiple agents with identical host and port details.
                Pulse will recognise agents that share a host and act accordingly.
            </td>
        </tr>
            <tr>
                #actionHeader("built.in.docs" "built-in documentation" "accept" false)
                <td>
                    The documentation for Pulse files is now built-in to the Pulse server, so that
                    it matches the exact version and plugin set you have installed.  Clicking the
                    book link in the top right-hand corner of the UI opens this reference
                    documentation.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                #actionHeader("pluggable.commands" "pluggable commands" "accept" false)
                <td>
                    As part of the changes for multi-command projects, both command configuration
                    and the command APIs were overhauled.  These changes make plugging in a command
                    much easier than before.  As with other configurable elements, commands can now
                    be fully documented and integrated into the UI when plugged-in.  Single command
                    projects can use any plugged-in command with no extra effort for the plugin
                    author.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                #actionHeader("admin.ui.improvements" "admin ui improvements" "accept" false)
                <td>
                    Multiple improvements have been made to the administration user interface.  Most
                    notable among these are:
                    <ul class="points">
                        <li>A reduction in nesting in the configuration tree (simplifying navigation).</li>
                        <li>Performance improvements for large configuration sets.</li>
                    </ul>
                    These changes make the UI both simpler and snappier.
