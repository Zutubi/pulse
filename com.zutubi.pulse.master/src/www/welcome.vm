    <h1> :: what's new :: </h1>
    <p>
        Pulse 2.6 includes new features and improvements in a wide range of areas.  Key updates include:
    </p>
    <table class="template-actions" cellspacing="5px" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <tr>
            <th class="category" colspan="2">new in 2.6</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("concurrentpersonal" "concurrent personal builds" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Individual users may now run multiple personal builds in parallel.  Limits on concurrency
                can be set by administrators (via user groups).
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("agenthooks" "stage hooks on agents" "accept" false)
            <td>
                It is now possible to configure stage hooks to run their tasks on agents.  Task
                commands and working directories can also reference build properties.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("dynamicfields" "dynamic report fields" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Reports that plot custom fields may now reference fields dynamically using wildcards.
                This allows reports to adapt to changing fields without reconfiguration.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("retainrules" "retain rules" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Automatic cleanup rules have been augmented with retain rules.  These rules allow
                you to exclude matched builds from cleanup.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("triggerpermission" "project trigger hook permission" "accept" false)
            <td>
                A separate permission has been added for build hook triggering.  This allows granting
                of hook trigger rights without allowing write access to the project.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("shallowclones" "git shallow clones" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Git projects can now opt for shallow clones with a configurable depth to save on
                network I/O and disk space.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("concurrentpoll" "concurrent scm polling" "accept" false)
            <td>
                Pulse will now use multiple threads to poll a single SCM server, useful for large
                installations using a single SCM server like Perforce.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("apimethods" "remote api methods" "accept" false)
            <td>
                The remote API has been expanded to allow access to full server history, full
                agent state and upstream changelist information.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("cancelall" "cancel all builds" "accept" false)
            <td>
                A new action makes it much simpler to cancel all pending builds from the server
                activity tab.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            #actionHeader("more" "and more..." "accept" false)
            <td>
                This release also includes numerous smaller improvements and fixes. Many are
                behind-the-scenes, making Pulse more maintainable into the future.
            </td>
