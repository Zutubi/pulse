/**
 * <p>
 * Post processors are used to extract information from artifacts (including
 * command output) produced by commands.  Typical post processors search for
 * information such as:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     Features: error, warning or information messages (e.g. compiler
 *     errors)
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Test results: by parsing test reports (e.g. xUnit XML report files)
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Rather than implementing this interface directly, we recommend extending
 * one of the various support classes where possible.  These classes simplify
 * common cases and reduce coupling to implementation details.
