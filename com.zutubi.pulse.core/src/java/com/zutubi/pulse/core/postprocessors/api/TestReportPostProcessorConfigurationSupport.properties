suite.label=add to suite
suite.verbose=If specified, all tests found by this processor will be added to a nested suite with \
  the given name.

failOnFailure.label=fail build on broken test
failOnFailure.verbose=If true, the build will be failed when any broken test case is found.  This \
  includes both errors and failures.

resolveConflicts.label=name conflict resolution
resolveConflicts.verbose=Determines how to resolve conflicting test cases (two cases with \
  identical names). Possible resolutions are:\
  <ul>\
    <li>off: conflicting tests are combined into one test with the most severe result (e.g. \
    failure preferred to success)</li>\
    <li>append: conflicting names are resolved by appending an integer to the later test name (the \
    integer is incremented until a unique name is found)</li>\
    <li>prepend: conflicting names are resolved by prepending an integer to the later test name \
    (the integer is incremented until a unique name is found)</li>\
  </ul>

expectedFailureFile.label=expected failure file
expectedFailureFile.verbose=<p>Path, relative to the base directory for the recipe, of a file \
  containing expected failure information.  This file should be a simple text file with the \
  fully-qualified names of test cases one per line.  A qualified case name has the form:</p>\
  <p><pre>\
      &lt;suite name&gt;/&lt;suite name&gt;/&lt;case name&gt;\
  </pre></p>\
  <p>where the suite names are the (possibly nested) suites under which the case is found.  If a \
  name contains a slash it should be percent-encoded as %2f, likewise a literal percent should be \
  encoded as %25.</p>\
  <p>If any cases listed in the file fail, their status will be marked as "expected failure".  The \
  recipe will not be failed due to such failures.</p>
