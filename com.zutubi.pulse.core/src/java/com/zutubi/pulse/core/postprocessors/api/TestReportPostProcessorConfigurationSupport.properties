suite.label=add to suite
suite.verbose=If specified, all tests found by this processor will be added to a nested suite with \
  the given name.

failOnFailure.label=fail build on failure
failOnFailure.verbose=If true, the build will be failed when any test case failure is found.

resolveConflicts.label=name conflict resolution
resolveConflicts.verbose=Determines how to resolve conflicting test cases (two cases with \
  identical names). Possible resolutions are:\
  <ul>\
    <li>off: conflicting tests are combined into one test with the most severe result (e.g. \
    failure preferred to success)</li>\
    <li>append: conflicting names are resolved by appending an integer to the later test name (the \
    integer is incremented until a unique name is found)</li>\
    <li>prepend: conflicting names are resolved by prepending an integer to the later test name \
    (the integer is incremented until a unique name is found)</li>\
  </ul>
