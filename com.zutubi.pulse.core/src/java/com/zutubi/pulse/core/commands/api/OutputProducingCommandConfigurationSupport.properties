postProcessors.label=post processors
postProcessors.verbose=The post-processors to apply to the output of this command.  Note that many \
  commands apply a post-processor by default, so it is not necessary to configure such standard \
  processors.
postProcessors.addable.brief=Specifies a post-processor to apply to the command output.
postProcessors.addable.verbose=Specifies a post-processor to apply to the output captured from \
  a command.  The captured output includes both stdout and stderr.
postProcessors.addable.attribute=A reference to the processor to apply (e.g. $'{'my.pp'}').

outputFile.label=output file
outputFile.verbose=If set, the command output will be captured to this file, which is specified \
  as a path relative to the command'''s working directory.  Note that output captured in this way \
  is only useful during the recipe execution itself, it is not captured as part of the command \
  result (the same output already is as a default capture).
