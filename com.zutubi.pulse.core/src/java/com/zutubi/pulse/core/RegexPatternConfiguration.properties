label=pattern
introduction=A regular expression used to capture features of some category.
verbose=A single regular expression paired with a "category" (or severity).  Used to capture \
  features of that category as part of a post-processor.

category.label=category
category.verbose=Specifies the severity of features that match this pattern, i.e. whether they are \
  errors, warnings or just informative.

expression.label=expression
expression.verbose=The regular expression to search for, in the syntax used by the java.util.regex \
  package (very similar to Perl regular expressions).
expression.example.1=\\.[ch]:[0-9]+: error
expression.example.1.blurb=Match a gcc-style compiler error

summary.label=summary
summary.verbose=If specified, features created by matching this pattern will have the summary \
  given. By default, the entire matched line is added as the feature summary. If a custom message \
  is desired, use this attribute to provide it. The summary specified may include references to \
  groups in the original expression (see the example below). Note that custom summaries are likely \
  to cause confusing summaries if leading and/or trailing context is also captured.
summary.example.1=Test case \\$1 failed
summary.example.1.blurb=Apply a custom summary to indicate the failure of a test with a matched name

exclusions.label=exclusions
exclusions.verbose=A list of regular expressions that, if matching, will exclude a line from being \
  matched by this pattern.  Used to override undesireable matches of the primary expression.
exclusions.addable.brief=A regular expression matching lines to exclude from this pattern.
exclusions.addable.verbose=Specifies a regular expression that, if matching will exclude a line \
  from being matched by the parent pattern.  As lines match the parent pattern they are checked \
  against exclusions which may except them from matching.
exclusions.addable.attribute=A regular expression matching lines to exclude.
