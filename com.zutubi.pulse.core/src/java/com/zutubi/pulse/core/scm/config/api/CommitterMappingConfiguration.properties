label=committer mapping
introduction=Committer mappings are used to convert SCM logins to user email addresses.
verbose=Committer mappings can be used to map from SCM logins to user email addresses when this \
  mapping is not trivial (i.e. the SCM login does not match the first part of the email address). \
  The mapping is used when Pulse needs to email users that have committed changes (e.g. in a \
  post-build hook with an email committers hook task).

scmLogin.label=scm login
scmLogin.verbose=The SCM login to match.  Changes attributed to this login will be mapped to the \
  email address.

email.label=email
email.verbose=The email address to map the login to.  If this address includes an @, it will be \
  taken as the whole address.  Otherwise the default email domain configured elsewhere (e.g. on an \
  email committers hook task) will be appended.
